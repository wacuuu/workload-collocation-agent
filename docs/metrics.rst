Metrics sources
===============

Check out `metrics sources documentation <metrics_sources.rst>`_ for more details how metrics 
are measured and about labels/levels.

For searchable list of metrics `metrics as csv file <metrics.csv>`_ .

Legend	
======

- **Name**: is the name of metric that will be exported to Prometheus by using Prometheus 
  exposition format but also the name of the key in ``Measurements`` dict-like 
  type used in ``Detector`` and ``Allocator`` plugins,	
- **Help**: information what metric represents and some 
  details how metric was collected and known problems or limitations,	
- **Unit**: unit of the metric (usually seconds or bytes),	
- **Type**: only possible types are `gauge` and `counter` as described 
  in `Prometheus metric types <https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/>`_.	
- **Source**: short description about mechanics that was used to collect metric,	
  for more detailed information check out `Metric sources documenation <metric_sources.rst>`_.	
- **Enabled** - column describes if metric is enabled by default and 
  how to enable (option in ``MeasurementRunner`` responsible for configuring it. 
  Please refer to `metrics sources documentation <metrics_sources.rst>`_ for more details.)	
- **Levels/Labels** - some metrics have additional dimensions (more granularity than just ``Task`` 
  or ``Platform``) e.g. ``task_mem_numa_pages`` can be collected per NUMA node - in this case	
  this metrics have attached additional label like ``numa_node=0`` which creates new series in	
  Prometheus nomenclature and represents more granular information about source of metric. 
  When used in python API in ``Detector`` or ``Allocator`` classes this will be 
  represented by nested dicts where each level have keys corresponding to "level" (order is important).	
  For example doubly nested perf uncore metrics like: ``platform_cas_count_reads`` 
  have two levels: `socket` and `pmu_type` (which physically represents memory controller) 
  will be encoded as::	

    platform_cas_count_reads{socket=0, pmu_type=17} 12345	

  and represented in Python API as::	

    measurements = {'platform_cas_count_reads': {0: {17: 12345}}}
