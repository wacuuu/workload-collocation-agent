StaticNode
==========

Simple implementation of Node that returns tasks based on
provided list on tasks names.

Tasks are returned only if corresponding cgroups exists:

- ``/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/(task_name)``
- ``/sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct/(task_name)``
- ``/sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event/(task_name)``

Otherwise, the item is ignored.

- ``require_pids``: **bool** = *False*
- ``default_labels``: **Dict[Str, Str]** = *{}*

NUMAAllocator
=============


For fuller documentation please refer to `NUMAAllocator documentation <numa_allocator.rst>`_.

Allocator aims to minimize remote NUMA memory accesses for processes.

- ``algorithm``: **NUMAAlgorithm** = *'fill_biggest_first'*:
    - *'fill_biggest_first'*

        Algorithm only cares about sum of already pinned task's memory to each numa node.
        In each step tries to pin the biggest possible task to numa node, where sum of
        pinned task is the lowest.

    - *'minimize_migrations'*

        Algorithm tries to minimize amount of memory which needs to be remigrated
        between numa nodes.  Into consideration takes information: where a task
        memory is allocated (on which NUMA nodes), which are nodes where the sum
        of pinned memory is the lowest and which are nodes where most
        free memory is available.

- ``loop_min_task_balance``: **float** = *0.0*:

    Useful when autoNUMA used on system.
    Minimal value of task_balance so the task is not skipped during rebalancing analysis
    by default turn off, none of tasks are skipped due to this reason.

- ``free_space_check``: **bool** = *False*:

    If True, then do not pin task to node where there is not enough free memory.


- ``migrate_pages``: **bool** = *True*:

    If use syscall "migrate pages" (forced, synchronous migrate pages of a task)


- ``migrate_pages_min_task_balance``: **Optional[float]** = *0.95*:

    Works if migrate_pages == True. Then if set tells,
    when remigrate pages of already pinned task.
    If not at least ``migrate_pages_min_task_balance * TASK_TOTAL_SIZE``
    bytes of memory resides on pinned node, then
    tries to remigrate all pages allocated on other nodes to target node.


- ``cgroups_memory_binding``: **bool** = *False*:

    cgroups based memory binding


- ``cgroups_memory_migrate``: **bool** = *False*:

    cgroups based memory migrating; can be used only when
    cgroups_memory_binding is set to True


- ``dryrun``: **bool** = *False*:

    If set to True, do not make any allocations - can be used for debugging.




StaticAllocator
===============

Simple allocator based on rules defining relation between task labels
and allocation definition (set of concrete values).

The allocator reads allocation rules from a yaml file and directly
from constructor argument (passed as python dictionary).
Refer to configs/extra/static_allocator_config.yaml to see sample
input file for StaticAllocator.

A rule is an object with three fields:

- name,
- labels (optional),
- allocations.

First field is just a helper to name a rule.
Second field contains a dictionary, where each key is a task's label name and
the value is a regex defining the matching set of label values. If the field
is not included then all tasks match the rule.
The third field is a dictionary of allocations which should be applied to
matching tasks.

If there are multiple matching rules then the rules' allocations are merged and applied.

Arguments:

- ``rules``: **List[dict]** = *None*

    Direct way to pass rules.

- ``config``: **Path** = *None*

    Filepath of yaml config file with rules.



SSL
===


Common configuration for SSL communication.

- ``server_verify``: **Union[bool, Path(absolute=True, mode=os.R_OK)]** = *True*
- ``client_cert_path``: **Optional[Path(absolute=True, mode=os.R_OK)]** = *None*
- ``client_key_path``: **Optional[Path(absolute=True, mode=os.R_OK)]** = *None*




TaskLabelRegexGenerator
=======================

Generate new label value based on other label value.
